# PSOC&trade; Control C3M/P8: Hibernate GPIO wakeup

This code example demonstrates how to use Hibernate power mode on a PSOC&trade; Control C3M/P8 MCU and wake the device using a GPIO pin. The main CM33 core toggles LED3 eight times to indicate it is active, then configures pin P7.0 (USER-BTN2 / SW4) as a low-level Hibernate wakeup source and enters Hibernate mode. Pressing SW4 asserts the pin low, which wakes the device from Hibernate. The MCU restarts and the application detects the Hibernate wakeup reset reason to print a wakeup message. Two PPCA cores independently blink LED1 and LED2 to demonstrate continued multicore operation between Hibernate cycles.

## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-ce241731-hibernate-gpio](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce241731-hibernate-gpio)" application with the desired name "HibernateGpio" configured for the *KIT_PSC3M8_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_PSC3M8_EVK --app-id mtb-example-ce241731-hibernate-gpio --user-app-name HibernateGpio --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>

## Design and implementation


### Resources and settings

The Arm® Cortex® MCU initiates operations after the initialization of GPIOs, UART, and interrupt. The MCU starts blinking an LED a few times to indicate that it goes into Hibernate mode. Press the input button to wakeup the MCU from Hibernate mode. Hibernate mode requires the MCU to reset and execute. If the MCU is waking up from Hibernate mode, then the reset reason message is sent on the UART terminal.

The application uses the UART to print messages on the UART terminal. The UART resource initialization and retargeting of standard I/O to the UART port is performed using the [retarget-io](https://github.com/Infineon/retarget-io) library.

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :-------- | :-------------    | :------------
 UART (HAL) |DEBUG_UART_hal_obj   | UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for the Debug UART port
 GPIO (PDL) | CYBSP_USER_LED1      | User LED1 from PPCA Core 0
 GPIO (PDL) | CYBSP_USER_LED2      | User LED2 from PPCA Core 1
 GPIO (PDL) | CYBSP_USER_LED3      | User LED3 from Main Core
